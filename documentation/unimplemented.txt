Core Reservation Engine & Basic Management
Goal: Implement the fundamental ability for customers to make reservations and for staff/owners to manage them, along with the necessary setup for seat options.
Features:

Core Reservation System - Customer Flow (Steps 1-3, 5):
Allow customers to browse bars (already exists) and initiate a reservation.
Implement steps: Selecting date, choosing a seat option, entering party size, confirming reservation.
Core Reservation System - Basic Validation:
Check date validity (basic format/future date).
Ensure party size fits within the selected seat optionâ€™s min/max limits.
Core Reservation System - Storage:
Store confirmed reservations in the database (linking user, bar, seat option, date, party size, initial status 'pending' or 'confirmed').
Core Reservation System - View Reservations (Customer):
Allow customers to view a list of their own reservations and their status.
Core Reservation System - Reservation Management (Staff/Owner):
Enable staff and owners to view reservations for their assigned bar(s).
Implement functionality to change reservation status (e.g., confirm, cancel).
UI Enhancements - Basic Feedback:
Implement simple toast messages for reservation success/failure.
