Okay, designing a robust availability check across a multi-step reservation process requires careful consideration of user experience, data consistency, and performance. Here's an optimal solution leveraging Supabase features, aiming to prevent users from proceeding with unavailable options while minimizing friction:

Core Principles:

Early Feedback: Inform the user about unavailability as soon as possible in the flow.

Progressive Checks: Perform checks relevant to the current step.

Final Atomic Check: Perform a definitive check immediately before creating the reservation to handle race conditions.

Minimize Realtime Overhead: Use Realtime selectively where it provides significant benefit without excessive load.

Optimal Solution Breakdown:

Step 1: Select Date (Using DateSelection.tsx)

Mechanism: Use Approach B (Pre-compute isFullyBooked Flag) as decided previously.

Backend: The get-bar-availability Edge Function (single call).

Calculates isOpen, isException, openTime, closeTime, isFullyBooked.

Returns this data for the date range.

Frontend:

DateSelection.tsx fetches data on load/view change.

Disables dates that are closed OR already fully booked (isFullyBooked = true).

Displays open times and "(Special Hours)" upon selection.

Displays "Available" or "Fully Booked" status based on the fetched isFullyBooked flag.

Availability Check: Checks if the entire day is already impossible due to being closed or completely full across all seat types. Prevents selection of fundamentally unavailable dates.

Benefit: Immediate feedback on date-level availability. Single API call for this step.

Step 2: Select Seat

Pre-computation (Data needed from Step 1): The frontend already knows the selected date and that it's not fully booked overall.

Mechanism: Fetch detailed seat availability for the selected date only when entering this step.

Backend: Use a new Edge Function (or potentially an RPC function, but Edge Functions are generally preferred for API-like operations). Let's call it get-seats-for-date.

Input: barId, target_date (YYYY-MM-DD).

Authentication: Requires JWT.

Logic:

Fetch all enabled seat_options for barId (get type, available_count, min_people, max_people).

Count confirmed reservations for barId on target_date, grouped by seat_type.

Calculate remaining seats for each enabled type (remaining_count = available_count - reserved_count).

Output: An array or object detailing each enabled seat type and its current remaining count.

{
  "seatDetails": [
    { "type": "table", "remainingCount": 5, "minPeople": 2, "maxPeople": 4 },
    { "type": "vip", "remainingCount": 16, "minPeople": 4, "maxPeople": 8 },
    // 'bar' type omitted if it had 0 remaining or was disabled
  ]
}


Frontend:

When navigating to the "Select Seat" step, call get-seats-for-date for the selectedDate.

Display only the seat types returned in the response (those that are enabled and potentially have > 0 seats, although the backend can return 0).

Show the remainingCount next to each seat type option.

Disable seat type options where remainingCount <= 0.

(Later): Validate selected party_size against minPeople/maxPeople for the chosen seat type.

Availability Check: Checks availability per seat type for the chosen date. Prevents selection of seat types that are already full.

Benefit: User sees real-time remaining counts for seat types. Prevents proceeding if the desired seat type is full. Relatively efficient as it only queries for one date.

Step 3: Select Drinks

Mechanism: No specific availability check needed here related to dates or seats. This step likely involves fetching drink options for the bar.

Availability Check: None related to time/capacity.

Step 4: Review & Complete (The Critical Point)

Mechanism: Use a Database Function (RPC) called immediately before inserting the reservation record. This leverages database transaction guarantees for atomicity.

Backend (RPC Function): Create a PostgreSQL function using plpgsql. Let's call it create_reservation_if_available.

Input: p_customer_id, p_bar_id, p_reservation_date, p_party_size, p_seat_type, p_special_requests (and potentially drink info if stored with reservation).

Authentication: Relies on RLS policies combined with the user's session calling the RPC. Ensure only the logged-in user can create reservations for themselves.

Logic (within a single transaction):

Re-check Bar Open: Verify the bar is open on p_reservation_date (using exceptions/hours - can embed this logic or call helper functions). If closed, RAISE EXCEPTION.

Get Seat Option Details: Fetch the seat_option for p_bar_id and p_seat_type. Check if enabled = true and if p_party_size is within min_people/max_people. If not valid, RAISE EXCEPTION. Let this be v_available_count.

Count Confirmed Reservations (Locking): Count confirmed reservations for p_bar_id, p_reservation_date, and p_seat_type. Crucially, use SELECT COUNT(*) ... FOR UPDATE or similar locking mechanism if your database concurrency allows, to prevent race conditions where two users try to book the last seat simultaneously. Let this be v_reserved_count.

Final Availability Check: Check if v_available_count - v_reserved_count > 0 (or >= 1 if thinking seats). If not enough seats remain, RAISE EXCEPTION('No seats available for this type').

Insert Reservation: If all checks pass, INSERT the new reservation record into the reservations table with status = 'confirmed'.

Return Success: Return the ID of the newly created reservation or a success indicator.

Error Handling: Use RAISE EXCEPTION for different failure reasons (closed, party size invalid, no seats). The Supabase client will catch these as errors.

Frontend:

When the user clicks "Complete Reservation":

Show a loading indicator.

Call the create_reservation_if_available RPC function using supabase.rpc(...) with all the collected reservation details.

If the RPC call succeeds: Navigate to a confirmation page.

If the RPC call fails: Catch the error. Parse the error message (which should indicate the reason: "No seats available", "Bar closed", etc.) and display an informative message to the user. Keep them on the review page so they can potentially change details (like date or seat type, requiring going back).

Availability Check: The definitive, atomic check performed at the moment of booking within a database transaction. Handles race conditions.

Benefit: Highest level of data consistency. Prevents overbooking. Gives specific reasons for failure.

Why not Realtime?

Overhead: Subscribing every user viewing the calendar or seat selection to realtime updates on reservation counts for potentially many dates/seat types would create significant database load and network traffic.

Complexity: Managing realtime subscriptions and UI updates based on granular count changes is complex.

Necessity: The RPC check at the end provides the necessary guarantee against overbooking. While realtime could update the counts dynamically in Step 2, the potential for slightly stale data there is usually acceptable, given the final check in Step 4. Showing counts that are a few seconds/minutes old in Step 2 is generally fine, as long as the final booking step is accurate.

Summary of Optimal Flow:

Date Select: Edge Function (get-bar-availability) provides open/closed/fully_booked status upfront (single call). Frontend disables invalid dates.

Seat Select: Edge Function (get-seats-for-date) provides remaining counts for the chosen date only (second call, triggered by user action). Frontend disables full seat types.

Drinks Select: No availability check needed.

Review & Complete: Database RPC Function (create_reservation_if_available) performs an atomic check-and-insert (third call, triggered by user action). This is the final gatekeeper.

This multi-layered approach provides good UX with early feedback while ensuring data integrity through the final transactional check.
