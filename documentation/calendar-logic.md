Context:

A Supabase Edge Function named get-bar-availability has already been created, deployed, and configured.

This function calculates which dates a specific bar is open based on its operating_hours and bar_exceptions tables (giving exceptions higher priority).

The function endpoint URL looks like: https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/get-bar-availability/{barId}.

It accepts GET requests with query parameters: start_date (YYYY-MM-DD) and end_date (YYYY-MM-DD).

It returns a JSON object: { "availableDates": ["YYYY-MM-DD", "YYYY-MM-DD", ...] }.

Crucially, the function requires JWT authentication ("Enforce JWT Verification" is enabled), meaning only logged-in users of your application can successfully call it.

Next Steps (Frontend Implementation):

Frontend Setup:

Ensure you have a frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.) set up.

Install a date manipulation library (e.g., date-fns or dayjs: npm install date-fns).

Install a suitable calendar/date-picker component library (e.g., react-calendar, Material UI DatePicker, etc.: npm install react-calendar).

Initialize the Supabase JavaScript client (@supabase/supabase-js) in your frontend using your project's public anon key.

Calculate Date Range:

In the relevant frontend component (where the calendar will be displayed):

Use your date library to get the current date ("today") at the start of the day (00:00:00).

Calculate the maximum allowed date (maxDate) by adding exactly one month to "today".

Format both "today" and maxDate into 'YYYY-MM-DD' strings (todayString, maxDateString). These will be used for the API call.

Implement API Client Function:

Create an asynchronous JavaScript/TypeScript function (e.g., fetchAvailableDates) responsible for calling the get-bar-availability Edge Function.

This function MUST:

Accept barId, startDate (YYYY-MM-DD), and endDate (YYYY-MM-DD) as arguments.

Construct the correct endpoint URL using the function slug, barId, startDate, and endDate.

Use supabase.auth.getSession() to retrieve the currently logged-in user's session, specifically extracting the access_token (JWT).

Make a fetch request (Method: GET) to the constructed endpoint URL.

Include the Authorization: Bearer <access_token> header in the fetch request. This is essential because the Edge Function enforces JWT verification.

Include standard headers like 'Content-Type': 'application/json'.

Handle potential errors (network errors, non-200 responses, especially 401 Unauthorized if the token is invalid/expired).

Parse the JSON response and return the availableDates array (or an empty array on error).

(Refer to the specific fetchAvailableDates code provided in the previous detailed answer for the correct implementation including JWT handling).

Calendar Component Integration:

Render your chosen calendar component within your frontend UI.

Use component state (e.g., React's useState) to store the array of available date strings received from the API (let's call this state availableDatesState). Initialize it as an empty array.

Use a side-effect hook (e.g., React's useEffect) to:

Call your fetchAvailableDates function when the component mounts (or when the relevant barId changes). Pass the barId, todayString, and maxDateString as arguments.

Update the availableDatesState with the results from the API call.

Configure Calendar Behavior:

Set Maximum Date: Configure the calendar component to prevent navigation and selection beyond the calculated maxDate object. Use the component's prop for this (e.g., maxDate={maxDate}).

Disable Unavailable Dates: Configure the calendar component to disable specific date tiles. Use the availableDatesState. Pass a function to the relevant prop (e.g., tileDisabled in react-calendar). The logic inside this function should be: ({ date }) => !availableDatesState.includes(format(date, 'yyyy-MM-dd')). This disables any date whose 'YYYY-MM-DD' string is not found in the availableDatesState array.

Testing:

Load the component in your application while logged in.

Verify that the calendar correctly disables dates that are not returned by the get-bar-availability function for the next month.

Confirm that the calendar visually prevents interaction with dates beyond one month from today.

Check the browser's network tab to ensure the API call to the Edge Function is successful (Status 200 OK) and includes the Authorization header. Check for any console errors.

Execute these frontend steps to complete the feature. The backend foundation is already in place.
